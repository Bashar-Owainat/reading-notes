# HTML & CSS
## Chapter 3 (Lists)
#### In HTML there are three types of lists: 
- ordered list (uses numbers)
- unordered list (uses bullets)
- definition lists (used to define terminology)

## Chapter 13 (Boxes)
- Each HTML element is treated as if it has its own box in CSS.
- You can control the dimensions, borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
- In CSS you can hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- You can make block-level boxes into inline boxes, and inline boxes into block-level boxes.
-  Controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading can help increase legibility.
- The ability to create image borders and rounded borders has introduced by CSS3.
