# Local Storage

localStorage is a property that allows JavaScript sites and apps to save key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date. This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window is closed

localStorage - stores data with no expiration date.

localStorage is a new JavaScript API in HTML5 that allows us to save data in key/value pairs in a user's browser. It's a little bit like cookies except: Cookies expire and get cleared a lot, localStorage is forever (until explicitly cleared)

LocalStorage is not a secure storage option. Many of the characteristics of local storage are similar to those of a cookie, including the same security problems. One of them is vulnerability to cross-site scripting, which steals cookies and allows hackers to masquerade a user with their site login session.
