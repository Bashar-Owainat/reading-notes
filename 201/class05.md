# Images, Color and Text

- To add image to a web page use < img >
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

## color
- Adding colors helps to convey the mood and bring the life to your site.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
 - RGB values,
 - hex codes,
 - and color names.

 - CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

 ## text

 - There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

 - There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
