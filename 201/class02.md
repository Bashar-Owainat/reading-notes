# HTML
## Chapter 2
- We use HTML elements to describe the structure of the page and they provide semantic information.

## Chapter 10
- CSS uses rules to show how HTML elements should look, these rules are made up of sectors and declarations.
- (Sectors specify the elements)
- (Declarations show how these elements should look like, and they have two parts: the properties and the values of those properties)
- Most of the time CSS rules appear in a separate document, but sometimes it may appear within the HTML page.

## JS
## Chapter 2
- A script consists of a set of statements. Every sentence function as a step in a recipe and it has precise instructions.
- We use variables to store pieces of information temporary that is used in script.
- We can store more than one piece of related information in Arrays.
- In JavaScript there are different data types for variables such as numbers, strings, and Boolean.
- Expressions evaluate into a single value and rely on operators to calculate a value.

## Chapter 4
- When we have conditional statements, the code will decide what to do next.
- We can combine more than one set of comparison operators when using logical operators.
- If.. else allows you to execute a set of code if the statement is true and another set of code if the statement is false.
