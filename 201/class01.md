# HTML and CSS
## chapter 1
 HTML pages are text documents. 

 Tags are used in HTML to lend unique meaning to the data they surround.

 Tags are often referred to as elements and come in pairs.

Opening tags can carry attributes that require a name and a value. Attributes tell us more about the content of that element.

## chapter 8
 DOCTYPE is used to tell the browser the version of HTML you are using.

 To add a comment use < !--  comment    -->

 You can use the id and class to identify particular elements.

 If you want to group block-level and inline elements use the < div> and < span>.

 The use of < iframes> is to cut widows into your web pages that can be used to display other pages.

 This tag < meta> enables you to provide a variety of information about your web page.



## Chapter 17

 The new HTML5 elements help to describe the structure of a web page and show the purpose of different parts of it.

 The new HTML5 elements provide clear code because you don’t have to use multiple < div> elements.

 If a browser doesn’t understand HTML5 elements it needs to be told the elements that are block-level elements.

If you want to use HTML5 elements in internet Explorer 8 or older you need extra JavaScript. 

## Chapter 18
- It really important to study the target audience.
- Site maps are used to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes are used to organize that will be on each page.
- Communication is at the heart of design. Visitors should understand what are you try to tell them.


## CSS
 A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. It’s not necessary to use all the instructions each time the script runs it might use a subset of them.

To deal with writing a script break the goal into a set of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete the task.
