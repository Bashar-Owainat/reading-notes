# Tables
To add tables to a web page we use the < table> element.

- The table is drawn out row by row.
- each row is created with < tr> element and has a number of cells represented by the < td> element or < th > if it's a header

- using the rowspan and colspan you can make cells of aa table spam more than one row or colomn.
- If you  have a long table you can split it into a < thead>, < tbody> and < tfoot>

# FUnctions, Methods & Objects

We can define functions that they are sets of related statements that represent a single task.

In order to make the functions work they may take parameters.

An object is a set of variables and fuctions that represent things in the real world.

There are built-in objects in JavaScript such as Stirng, Number, Math and Date.
