# forms
we use forms when we want to collect information from visitors. 

Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

# lists , tables and forms
List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.

Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS

# events
Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened.

When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
