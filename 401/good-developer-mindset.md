There are plenty of small factors that damage a developer's projects over time. They aren't instantly harmful. The majority of them only cause long-term harm. For a year or more, you won't be able to see the harm. As a result, when they are proposed, they frequently appear to be harmless.


In order to over come this, there are some points every developer must master:
1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software

    Developers that are unable to comprehend the project's goal will produce poor software. What is the definition of terrible software? A complicated system that accomplishes little to assist individuals.

2. Putting Goals for Software Design to help users

    When software is difficult to create or alter, developers focus their efforts on having things "just work," rather than on assisting users. The goal of software design is to make the job of developers as simple as possible so that they may focus on what matters. You will develop software that will benefit users and will continue to do so for a long time.

3. (Mis)understanding
    Developers who do not fully comprehend their task are more likely to create complex systems. It's easy to become caught up in the cycle: misunderstanding leads to complication, which leads to even more misunderstanding, and so on.
    Actually, one of the most effective methods to improve your design skills is to ensure that you have a thorough understanding of the systems and tools you're using.

4. Simplicity
    The act of programming is the reduction of complexity to simplicity. A "poor developer" is just someone who is incapable of reducing complexity. A "good developer" does everything possible to make the code as easy to understand as possible for other programmers.

    A competent developer makes things that are simple to grasp so that all of the bugs may be found quickly.

5. Complexity
    Complexity is the root of many software failures. You begin with a straightforward job that may be completed in a month. When you add complexity to the equation, the work can take up to three months to complete. Then you start adding features that have a different function. Things become extremely complicated as a result of your software's purpose being expanded for no apparent reason. It will take six months to complete the duties.

6. Maintenance
     One of the most critical aspects of software development is maintenance. Unfortunately, most developers overlook its significance. Code maintenance appears to be less significant than quick coding and delivering. This is where they make a mistake: they are unaware of the importance of future code maintenance.

7. Consistency
    Consistent code is more difficult to comprehend. Don't make engineers re-learn how to use your system every time they look at a new part of it.
