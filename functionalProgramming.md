Functional programming (commonly abbreviated FP) is a method of creating software by composing pure functions without the use of shared state, changeable data, or side effects. The state of an application flows through pure functions in functional programming, which is declarative rather than imperative. In object-oriented programming, on the other hand, application state is generally shared and collocated with object methods.

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, which means it is a way of thinking about software development that is built on a set of defining concepts (listed above). Object-oriented programming and procedural programming are two other programming paradigms.

An immutable object (also known as an unchangeable object) is one whose state cannot be changed after it has been created. Other advantages include being easier to comprehend and reason about, as well as providing more security than mutable objects.
