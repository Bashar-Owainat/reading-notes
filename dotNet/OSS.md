why developers contribute to open-source software

- Improve Coding Skills

Contributing to OSS allows developers to not only exercise their programming skills, but also to learn from and receive criticism from more experienced programmers. This hands-on approach to learning provides budding programmers with real-world, first-hand experience and significantly shortens their learning curve.


-  Gain Early Experience

Contributing to OSS allows developers to improve their ability to comprehend code written by others, detect and fix issues, and add their code to the main repository. All of these are actions that developers encounter while working at a software company.


- Increase Community and Peer Recognition

Recognition from members of the open source community not only stimulates and motivates developers to enhance their abilities, but it may also lead to a variety of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events.

Self-recognition and personal achievement are also essential aspects of this statement. Many developers are driven to be the greatest developer they can be in order to attain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a large OSS project is regarded as a huge accomplishment.

- Greater Job Prospects

Contributing to OSS can improve your chances of securing an internship as well as your job and career prospects. When many software businesses receive a CV from a prospective developer, they typically skim the sheets of paper and spend more time researching the applicant's Github account.

Because OSS is public, prospective employers can check your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code you have created. Commercial (proprietary) software, on the other hand, does not supply you with the same proof of your ability, and it is far more difficult to develop expertise in this sector.
