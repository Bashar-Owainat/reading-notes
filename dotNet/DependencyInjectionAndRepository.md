# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern 

## What is a dependency?
Itâ€™s an object that is being dependent on by another object


## What does dependency inversion men?
It specifies that high-level modules should not rely on low-level modules, but rather on abstractions. Details should not be relied upon in abstracts. Abstractions should be used to determine the details.

## What is repository design pattern?
A set of classes or components that incapsulate the functionality necessary to access data sources. They consolidate the functionality for accessing common data and that results in providing better maintainability.

## What is the benefit of repository design pattern?
It can assist to apply loose coupling and keep domain objects persistence ignorant.

## What are the SOLID principles?
-	Single Responsibility Principle: every method or class should have only on job.

-	The Open/Close Principle: a class or a method be open for extension, but closed for modification.

-	The Liskov Substitution Principle: Without causing the program to break, an object in your application should be able to be replaced with a type derived from it.

-	The Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be pushed to depend on interfaces they don't use

-	The Dependency Inversion Principle: that high-level modules should not rely on low-level modules, but rather on abstractions. Details should not be relied upon in abstracts. Abstractions should be used to determine the details.
