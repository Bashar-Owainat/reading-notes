## Classes
-	A class is a reference type

-	If you declare a class, it will give you null at run time unless you created an instance of that class by using the new operator or you can assign it to another object that is already declared in the code.

-	You can declare a class the (class) keyword

-	The access level comes before the class keyword.

-	The name of the class becomes after the class keyword

-	Classes are not considered objects; they just define the type of objects.

-	An object is an instance of a class


-	We can create an object by following this format: ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName();






## Constructors
-	A constructor is a method that is used to initialize the parameters of new object.

-	The constructor has the same name of the class

-	A class can have multiple constructors

-	Constructors allow programmers to limit instantiation.

-	Constructors help to write flexible and clean code



## Properties

-	Properties are members that allow us to read or write values of private fields.

-	Properties hide the implementation of the code

Examples on properties: 

-	Get: it is used to return a value
-	Set: it is used to assign a new value



## Stack

-	Stack is a temporary storage memory that keeps track of invoked functions.

-	It is a linear data structure 
-	Stack memory cannot be fragmented
-	We cannot resize variables in stack
-	We can only access local variables in stack

## Heap
-	It is a memory that is used to store global variables
-	It is a hierarchical data structure
-	Its memory can become fragmented
-	Its variable can be resized
-	It has a faster access speed compared to stack
