# linked lists
-	A Linked List is a collection of Nodes that are linked or connected to one another.

-	A node is an item that contains data about links in a linked list

-	There are two types of linked lists: singly and doubly

-	Singly linked lists means that each node has only one reference that points to the next node.

-	Doubly linked lists means that the node has two references, one points to the previous node and the other points to the next node.

-	Head is a node that is considered as a reference to the first node in the linked list.

-	 If you want to traverse a linked list you cannot use foreach or for loop because we always have to check that the next node is not null. Instead, we can use while loop.

-	Time complexity O(n)

-	Space complexity O(1)

-	Linked lists are linear data structures (They are built in a certain order and in a certain sequence)

-	Linked lists are dynamic data structure (they can grow and shrink in memory)

-	Linked lists have non-contiguous memory allocation (bytes doesnâ€™t have to be in the same place)
