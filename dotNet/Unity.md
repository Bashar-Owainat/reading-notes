# Unity
## What is an asset in Unity?
Anything that can be used in your game or project is represented by an asset. An asset can be derived from a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D model, an audio file, an image, or any of the other file types supported by Unity.

## what primitive object types are there in unity, why do we use them?
The Cube, Sphere, Capsule, Cylinder, Plane, and Quad are among the primitive object types that can be produced directly from Unity. These objects are frequently useful in and of themselves (for example, a plane is commonly used as a flat ground surface), but they also provide a rapid way to generate placeholders and prototypes for testing reasons.

## what are the import settings for an image and an FBX file in Unity?
For an image you can specify whether it is imported as a texture, a 2D sprite, or a normal map in the import options.

As for an FBX file you can alter the scale of it, produce normals or lightmap coordinates, and split and trim animation clips defined in the file using the import options.
