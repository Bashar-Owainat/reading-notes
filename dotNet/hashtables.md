# Hashtables

## Terms related to Hashtables:
-	Hash: A hash is the output of an algorithm transforming an incoming string into a value that can be used for security or another purpose. It is used to determine the index of an array in the case of a hashtable.
-	Bucket: A bucket is what is contained in each index of the hashtable's array. Each index represents a bucket. If a collision occurs, an index may contain several key/value pairs.
-	Collision: A collision occurs when multiple keys are hashed to the same position in the hashtable.


## Why do we use hashtables?
-	Library
-	Dictionary
-	Hold unique values


## What are hashtables?
Hashtables are a type of data structure that uses key-value pairs. This means that each Node or Bucket has a key as well as a value.

## What is a hash?
It is the ability to encode the key, which will eventually translate to a specific point in the data structure from which we can directly obtain the value.

## What is the main idea behind hashtables?
A hashtable's primary concept is the ability to store the key in this data structure and rapidly retrieve the value. This is accomplished using a hash.
