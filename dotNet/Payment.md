## What is a Merchant Account?
The Merchant Account is the channel via which you connect to the credit card processing network. This account is responsible for ensuring that credit cards are handled accurately and safely; your bank account does not process credit cards. Merchant accounts accept (or deny) credit cards and deposit the proceeds into your bank account.

## What is the role of Payment Gateway?
The Payment Gateway is in charge of delivering credit card information to the relevant Internet Merchant Account via secure online channels.

## what are the actions that would take place if you had a program, such as online registration:
- The user inserts credit card information into the app.

- Credit card information is securely transmitted to the Payment Gateway.

- The Payment Gateway directs the credit card transaction to the correct Internet Merchant Account.

- For credit card processing, the Internet Merchant Account connects to the Merchant Account.

- The outcome is returned to the Gateway and then to the application.
