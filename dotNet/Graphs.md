#Graphs

##Give a definition for each term of the following:
-	Vertex: is a data item with one or more neighboring vertices.
-	Edge: It is a link between two nodes.
-	Neighbor: The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
-	Degree: It represents the number of edges that connect to that vertex.
## what is an undirected graph?
It is a graph with undirected or bi-directional edges. This signifies that the undirected graph moves in no direction.

## what is a directed graph?
It is a graph where every edge is directed. Itâ€™s also called digraph.

## what are the differences between complete, connected and disconnected.
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices / node have at least one edge.
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

## what is the difference between acyclic cyclic?

Acyclic graphs are directed graphs that lack cycles.

A cycle occurs when a node can be explored and potentially return to itself.

A cyclic graph is one that contains cycles.

A cycle is defined as a positive-length path that begins and finishes at the same vertex.
