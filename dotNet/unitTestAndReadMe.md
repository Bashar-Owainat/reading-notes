# Unit test & README
## Misconceptions about unit test
-	Unit tests aren't concerned with their environment and with external systems to the codebase

-	You haven't developed a unit test if you've written something that can fail when run on a machine lacking the "proper setup."

-	A unit test doesn’t produce random data and pepper it throughout your application in random sequences. It isn’t something that QA usually does.

-	A unit test doesn’t simulate the interaction of multiple components in your system.

What does a unit test actually mean?
-	A unit test is a type of test that uses specific components of your code that are isolated and then exercise them.

-	In c# a unit is something like a method so it should test specific thing.




## READ ME

-	The terminology goes back to at least the 1970s, however it could even be traced back to the days of instructional paper notes above stacks of punch cards with the words "READ ME!" scrawled on them, explaining how to use them.

-	Readme files provide an introduction to the files in the repository and eliminate the necessity for someone viewing or using your repository to read your thoughts.


-	The use of all-caps in README has been a constant feature throughout history. UNIX systems order capitals before lower case letters, putting the README ahead of the rest of the directory's content.

-	For module creators, After 6 months, a module with no documentation appears new and unfamiliar so it very important to create something that will last.

-	To avoid conflicts with what is published to the repository, a readme file should be updated on a regular basis.

-	A readme file should not be written in the style of an essay. It should only contain what is absolutely necessary.
