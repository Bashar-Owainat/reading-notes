## What is SendGrid?

SendGrid is an SMTP service provider, and it is used by freeCodeCamp to send out Quincy's weekly newsletter.


## What is SMTP?
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is the protocol used by internet servers to transfer email messages. When you send an email from your Gmail account, for example, your mail client sends the message to the server using SMTP. The server then sends it to the receiving server using SMTP.


## How to Set up Your Domain or Email with SendGrid? 

Select "Settings" from that dashboard page, then "Sender Authentication" from the dropdown menu. The Sender Authentication settings are where you tell SendGrid which email accounts you want to send emails from.

There are two ways here. If you have a custom domain for your emails, you can set up Domain Authentication. If you use a personal email account, such as Gmail, you must enable Single Sender Authentication.



## How create an API key?

Select "Settings," then "API Keys" from your dashboard display. Select "Create API Key" and the permissions you want for the key (I gave mine full permissions, just to avoid issues).

Once you've obtained the key, save it somewhere safe because you won't be able to access it again.
