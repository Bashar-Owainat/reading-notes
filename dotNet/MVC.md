# MVC
I will write what I read in a quiz form

## What is MVC?
(stands for model, viewer and controller) It is a design pattern or architecture that aids in the development of online applications in a more efficient manner than the typical ASP.NET Web Application.

## What is a model component?
It corresponds to all of the data-related logic with which the user interacts. This might represent either the data being transmitted between the View and Controller components or any other data related to business logic.

## Why do we use a viewer component?
It is responsible for the application's UI logic.

## What does a controller do?
It serves as an interface between the Model and View components, processing all business logic and incoming requests, manipulating data with the Model component, and interacting with Views to render the final output.

## What is ASP.NET MVC framework?
It is a lightweight, fully testable display framework that works alongside standard ASP.NET features.

## Give some examples on the ASP.NET MVC features.
-	Perfect for creating complicated but lightweight applications.
-	Provides a framework that is flexible and pluggable and can be easily updated and customized.
-	The application is designed as a component-based system, with Model, View, and Controller components.
-	Since all components can be built interface-based and evaluated using fake objects, the MVC framework improves test-driven development and application testability.
