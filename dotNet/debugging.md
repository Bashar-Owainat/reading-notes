## What is debugging?
-	A process we do using a debugging tool to figure out where exactly we made a programming mistake by running the code step by step.

## What should you do when you find the point that has the error?
-	You should ask yourself the right question in order to understand what correction can you do to solve the problem. You have to think of the assumptions that led to the error


The questions should be like: 
-	What did you expect your code to do?
-	What happened instead?
-	Am I using this API right?
-	Is there any typos?
