I’ll summarise what I read in a Quiz form.

### What is Inheritance?
It is one of object-oriented programming's three main properties. Inheritance allows you to make new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the functionality of existing ones.

### What is the base class?
It is the class whose members are inherited.

### What is the derived class?
It is the class that inherits another classes’ members

### Can a derived class have more than one direct class?
No

### Explain what does the following sentence mean: “Inheritance is transitive”.
If a class A inherits the properties of another class B, all subclasses of A will inherit the properties of B as well.

### What does the abstract keywork do?
It allows us to build incomplete classes and class members that must be implemented in a derived class.

### How can we declare an abstract class?
To declare an abstract class, write the abstract key word between the public and the class keywords.

### What is the purpose of abstract classes?
The main idea of abstract classes is to give a common definition of a base class that several derived classes can use.

### What is the difference between normal and abstract methods?
Abstract methods don’t have an implementation and they are followed by a semicolon.


### What does polymorphism mean?
It is the capacity of objects of various types to give an unique interface for various method implementations. 


### What are the four OOP principles?
1.	Abstraction
2.	Encapsulation
3.	Inheritance
4.	Ploymorphism
