## Data model attributes

- The DataType attribute is used to indicate a data type that is more particular than the intrinsic type of the database. We only want to keep track of the date in this situation, not the date and time. Many data types are supported by the DataType Enumeration, including Date, Time, PhoneNumber, Currency, EmailAddress, and others. The DataType attribute can also be used to enable the application to provide type-specific features automatically.

- For ASP.NET Core MVC, the StringLength attribute determines the maximum length in the database and enables client and server validation.


## DBMS - Overview
