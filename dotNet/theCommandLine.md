# The Command Line

What is a command line?
It is a text-based system interface that allows you to type commands on the keyboard and then receive feedback.

Pwd : is a command that gives you your current location
Ls : is a command that lists the directories 

-	The way we take so we can get to a directory is called a path
-	To refer to your current path you can use dot “.”
Cd : is a command that changes the directory

- When we use ls with -a this allows us to show hidden files

- files and directories names are case sensitive 
- to create a director use the command mkdir
- to remove a director use the command rmdir
- to create a file we can use the command touch
- to remove or rename a file we can use the mv command
