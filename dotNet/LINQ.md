I’ll will summarise what I read in a form of a quiz

## What is LINQ?
-	a collection of technologies centred on the direct integration of query capabilities into the C# programming language

## What can we use query expression for?
-	We use query expressions for querying and transforming data from any data source that supports LINQ.

## Why query expressions are easy to grasp?
-	because they make extensive use of C# language constructs.

## What is a query?
-	A query is an expression that is used for retrieving data from a data source like a database.

## what are the three main actions that all LINQ query operations consist of?
-	Obtain the data source.
-	Create the query.
-	Execute the query.

## what are the basic LINQ query operations?
-	Filtering: Only those elements for which the condition is true are returned by the query as a result of the filter. The “where” clause is used to generate the result.

-	Ordering: The “orderby” clause sorts the elements in the returned sequence using the default comparer for the type that is being sorted.


-	Grouping: You can use the group clause to group your results depending on a key you specify.

-	Joining: Join operations establish connections between sequences that aren't explicitly represented in the data sources.


-	Selecting: The select clause returns the query's results and specifies the "shape" or type of each element returned.
