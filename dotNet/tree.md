# Tree

I’ll summarise what I read about trees in a quiz form

## What is a tree?
A tree is a non-linear data structure in which nodes are connected by edges.

## give examples of the common terms used to describe a tree.
- (Node) A Tree node is a component that can have its own values as well as links to other nodes.
- (Root) The root is the very first node in the tree.
- (k) In a k-ary tree, this number determines the maximum number of children a node can have.
- (Left) In a binary tree, a reference to one child node.
- (Right) In a binary tree, a reference to one child node.
- (Edge) The link between a parent and child node in a tree is called an edge.
- (leaf) A node with no children is referred to as a leaf.


## Why do we need to traverse a tree?
-	To search for a node
-	To print the tree’s content 
## What are the types of traversals?
-	Depth First
-	Breadth Frist

## what are the methods for depth first traversal?
-	Pre-order which is root >> left >> right
-	In-order which is left >> root >> right
-	Post-order which is left >> right >> root
