Application Programming Interface (API) is a software middleman that allows two apps to communicate with one another. You utilize an API every time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone.
## An Example
When you use a mobile phone application, it connects to the Internet and sends information to a server. The server then retrieves the information, interprets it, takes the appropriate actions, and sends it back to your phone. The software then analyses the data and displays the information you requested in a legible fashion. All of this happens via API, which is what an API is.
