# CRUD
What exactly is CRUD?
The four essential functions that models should be able to do are Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).

Create, Read, Update, and Delete are all commands that can be used to create, read, update,
We want our models to provide four fundamental sorts of functionality when developing APIs. Resources must be able to be created, read, updated, and deleted by the model. The abbreviation CRUD is commonly used by computer scientists to refer to these functions. In order to be complete, a model should be able to fulfill at least these four functions. If an activity cannot be described using one of these four operations, it should be considered a separate model.

The CRUD paradigm is widely used in web application development because it provides a simple foundation for reminding developers how to build complete, useable models. Take, for example, a system for keeping track of library books. We may imagine that there would be a books resource in this hypothetical library database, which would hold book objects.
