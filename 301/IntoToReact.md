# Intro  to React
## Components 
A component is a well-defined set of modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable functionality that encapsulates and exports its implementation as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.

## Props

In React, “props” is a specific term that stands for properties and is used to send data from one component to another.

In a unidirectional flow, data with props are passed.

### How to use Props in React

- Then use Props to pass it to the child component(s).
- Render the Props Data at the end.
