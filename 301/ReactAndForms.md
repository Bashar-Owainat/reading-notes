# React and Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
<br>
A controlled component is one that renders and controls form elements by storing form data in the component's state. The data from the form element is processed by the React component (not the DOM) and saved in the component's state in a controlled component.

React employs forms to allow users to interact with the web page in the same way that HTML does.

## Handling Forms

<br>

As it comes to handling forms, it's all about how you manage the data when it changes or is submitted.

In HTML, form data is normally handled via the Document Object Model (DOM).

Form data is often handled by components in React.

All data is kept in the component state when it is handled by the components.

Add event handlers to the onChange attribute to govern changes.
