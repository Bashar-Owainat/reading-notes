In contrast to databases that store data on disk or SSDs, an in-memory database is a form of purpose-built database that stores data mostly in memory. Because all data is stored and controlled only in main memory, it is vulnerable to being lost in the event of a server or process failure.

Consider it analogous to transferring your money into a different currency when traveling between countries. For example, if a word is viewed (in a book) and converted (encoded) into a sound or a meaning, it can be kept (i.e. semantic processing).
