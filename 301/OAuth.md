# Authentication
## What exactly is OAuth?
<br><br><br>
OAuth is an open-standard authorisation mechanism or framework that enables “secure designated access” in apps. You can, for example, notify Facebook that ESPN.com can access your profile and post items to your timeline without giving ESPN your Facebook password. This significantly reduces risk: even if ESPN has a data breach, your Facebook password is safe.

OAuth does not disclose password information, instead relying on permission tokens to establish a connection between users and service providers. OAuth is a security mechanism that allows you to authorize one application to engage with another on your behalf without disclosing your password.
