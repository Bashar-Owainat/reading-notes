What are keys used for in React?
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

What does .map() return?
- it returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable like lists.

Lists are commonly used to display menus on websites and are used to display material in an ordered way. Lists can be generated in React in the same way that they are in JavaScript.
