In git we go through a set of stages:

1.	Git clone URL
 Which means to take a copy of the repository and make it local then make the changes you want.
2.	Git add .
 It’s used to save the changes you made and prepare it to be a new version.
3.	Git commit -m “why”
To make a new version. 
4.	Git push origin main
 It pushes back the changes on the local repository to github.
