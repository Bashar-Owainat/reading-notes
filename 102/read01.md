# Github and Markdown

- Github helps you turn your repository into a website to show your portfolio or project or whatever you want to show to the world.
- Github has no database to set up and no servers to configure.
- In most of the cases you don’t have to know HTML.
- Github serves your project sites from a personal URL that could contain your name or your organization 

**Markdown** is a language that helps to style text on the web. It is similar to HTML but doesn’t take a lot of time to load. 
Things you can apply in Markdown:
1.	Headers
2.	Emphasis
3.	Unordered list
4.	Ordered list
5.	Images
6.	Links
